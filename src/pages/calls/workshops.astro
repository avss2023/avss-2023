      <strong>AVSS 2023</strong> is the <strong>19th</strong> edition of the
      <strong>
        IEEE International Conference on Advanced Video and Signal-Based
        Surveillance,
      </strong>
      a premier forum for the presentation of new advances and research results in
      the field of video and signal-based surveillance. AVSS 2023 is
      <strong> sponsored by the IEEE Signal Processing Society.</strong>
      The goal is to provide a game-changing and cross-disciplinary forum that brings
      together experts from academia, industry, and government to advance the frontiers
      of theories, methods, systems, and applications.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      Typically, workshops on new and emerging topics/challenges related to
      video and signal-based surveillance and of interest to the community at
      large are held in conjunction with AVSS. Workshops will be held on
      <strong>November 9 (Thursday) 2023</strong>, after the main conference. We
      welcome workshop proposals in new and emerging research areas of visual
      and signal-based surveillance.
