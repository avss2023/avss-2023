<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>
  The automated analysis of crowds and the identification of crowd behaviors are
  crucial forpredicting adverse events, and in particular for appropriately
  designing public spaces, as well as for the real-time management of people
  flows.
</p>
<p>
  Scene understanding, especially motion analysis and trajectory prediction of
  targets, has been extensively exploited to understand the dynamic of an
  observed scene. Crowd models have been used to detect anomalies, predict paths
  and perform data-driven simulations. Most models and algorithms for the
  analysis of crowds are developed and tested using real-world videos and target
  different applications including personal mobility, safety and security, and
  enabling assistive robotics in public spaces.
</p>
<p>
  In crowd analysis as in multiple other research fields, the ever increasing
  demand for data to train modern machine learning and deep learning algorithms
  appears to be unstoppable.When dealing with supervised learning, the basic
  requirement is the availability of a large collection of labeled data. If the
  amount of annotated data is scarce, supervised solutions often overfit,
  leading, in the first place, to poor generalization capabilities. The
  literature has shown that this problem can be mitigated with a variety of
  regularization techniques, such as the dropout, batch normalization, transfer
  learning between different datasets, pre-training the network on different
  datasets, or implementing few-shot and zero-shot learning techniques.
</p>
<p>
  Still, there is an ever growing demand for data, to which researchers respond
  with larger andlarger datasets, at a huge cost in terms of acquisition,
  storage, and annotation of images and clips. However, when dealing with
  complex problems, it is common to validate the developed algorithms across
  different datasets, facing inconsistencies in annotations (i.e. segmentation
  maps vs bounding boxes), the use of different standards (i.e. the number of
  joints of human skeletons in OpenPose and SMPL).
</p>
<p>
  The use of synthetically-generated data can overcome such limitations, as the
  generation engine can be designed to fulfill an arbitrary number of
  requirements, all at the same time. For example, the same bounding box can
  hold for multiple viewpoints of the same object/scene; the 3D position of the
  object is always known, as well as its volume, the appearance, and the motion
  features. These considerations have motivated the adoption of
  computer-generated content to satisfy two requirements: (a) the visual
  fidelity and (b) thebehavioral fidelity.
</p>
<p>
  With this respect, crowd analysis provides a rich and diversified use case, in
  which synthetic data can play a relevant role: the scene should replicate the
  appearance of a crowd, which consists of multiple subjects of different
  appearance exhibiting different behaviors. These elements imply fulfilling the
  requirements of both visual fidelity and behavioral fidelity, simulating and
  modeling the diversity of motion patterns, as well as the ongoing social
  interactions.
</p>
<p>
  We expect contributions involving, but not limited to crowd analysis
  applications, and synthetic data applications.
