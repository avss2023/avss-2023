    <Paragraph>
      The sensor is a fundamental component for next-generation services such as
      smart cities, autonomous driving, and telemedicine. These services are
      expected to generate a significant amount of data, as numerous sensors
      will be used to monitor daily activities. However, with the increased use
      of sensors, concerns about privacy violations become more pronounced.
      Visual data privacy is one of the most crucial privacy concerns for
      individuals. Moreover, the importance of privacy protection is becoming
      increasingly relevant due to regulatory frameworks such as the European
      Unionâ€™s General Data Protection Regulation (EU GDPR) and the California
      Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which focus on safeguarding data privacy at
      the national level. In this workshop, we aim to engage with researchers
      from diverse backgrounds to explore innovative strategies for preserving
      the privacy of data. We seek to share advanced concepts and ideas on this
      topic, and to foster new perspectives on how privacy preservation can be
      achieved in this context. By doing so, we hope to identify promising
      research directions that will address the critical privacy issues
      surrounding the use of sensors in emerging technologies.

    <Paragraph>
      We conduct an extensive investigation of privacy-protecting methodologies
      for the surveillance and monitoring applications. Moreover, we explore not
      only direct information protection but also theoretical protection methods
      against learning model attacks such as inversion attacks, membership
      inference attacks. We will invite speakers with professional knowledge and
      experience about the topics:

    <Paragraph>
      We collect surveys or brief technical contributions about the
      privacy-preserving surveillance systems (PPSS). Authors are expected to
      submit extended abstract of the paper containing more than 300 words for
      each submission. If their contributions were accepted, the authors will
      give a 15-minute oral presentation at the workshop. The accepted
      contributions will be combined into a single merged workshop paper which
      will be included and published to the proceedings of IEEE AVSS 2023.

      <strong>Sung Whan Yoon (UNIST):</strong> He is currently an assistant professor
      at Graduate School of AI &amp; Department of Electrical Engineering at Ulsan
      National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST) since Mar. 2020. He received
      a Ph.D. degree from School of Electrical Engineering at Korea Advanced Institute
      of Science and Technology (KAIST), in Aug. 2017, under the supervision of Prof.
      Jaekyun Moon. Before joining UNIST, he was a postdoctoral researcher at KAIST
      from Sep. 2017 to Mar. 2020. His research interests are in the area of artificial
      intelligence, distributed learning systems, and intelligence communications.
      When focusing on the machine learning field, he has been dedicated to meta-learning
      algorithms for few-shot image recognitions (the results were published in ICML
      2019 &amp; NeurIPS Meta-Learning Workshop 2018). Also, he is interested in
      implementing algorithms for incremental/continual learning (the work was published
      in ICML 2020). In the further direction, he has suggested a domain generalization
      algorithm across diverse image domains (the related work was published in AAAI
      2023). He is also interested in federated learning systems for training deep
      models in a decentralized/private way (a recent work that combines meta-learning
      and federated learning was presented at AAAI Privacy-Preserving AI Workshop
      2023).
