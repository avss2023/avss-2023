<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>
  The sensor is a fundamental component for next-generation services such as
  smart cities, autonomous driving, and telemedicine. These services are
  expected to generate a significant amount of data, as numerous sensors will be
  used to monitor daily activities. However, with the increased use of sensors,
  concerns about privacy violations become more pronounced. Visual data privacy
  is one of the most crucial privacy concerns for individuals. Moreover, the
  importance of privacy protection is becoming increasingly relevant due to
  regulatory frameworks such as the European Unionâ€™s General Data Protection
  Regulation (EU GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which
  focus on safeguarding data privacy at the national level. In this workshop, we
  aim to engage with researchers from diverse backgrounds to explore innovative
  strategies for preserving the privacy of data. We seek to share advanced
  concepts and ideas on this topic, and to foster new perspectives on how
  privacy preservation can be achieved in this context. By doing so, we hope to
  identify promising research directions that will address the critical privacy
  issues surrounding the use of sensors in emerging technologies.

<h3 id="workshop-topics">Workshop Topics</h3>
<p>
  We conduct an extensive investigation of privacy-protecting methodologies for
  the surveillance and monitoring applications. Moreover, we explore not only
  direct information protection but also theoretical protection methods against
  learning model attacks such as inversion attacks, membership inference
  attacks. We will invite speakers with professional knowledge and experience
  about the topics:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Privacy protection methods for 2D/3D visual data (RGB images, 2D/3D key
    points or features, point clouds, Deep steganography, and others)
  </li>
  <li>Privacy threats on text generation model</li>
  <li>Privacy-preserving LiDAR, RADAR image/signal applications</li>
  <li>Privacy-preserving voice signal applications</li>
  <li>
    Theoretical foundations against model inversion attacks, membership
    inference attack
    <ul>
      <li>Differential Privacy</li>
      <li>Homomorphic Encryption</li>
      <li>Federated Learning</li>
    </ul>

<h3 id="program-description">Program Description</h3>
<p>
  We collect surveys or brief technical contributions about the
  privacy-preserving surveillance systems (PPSS). Authors are expected to submit
  extended abstract of the paper containing more than 300 words for each
  submission. If their contributions were accepted, the authors will give a
  15-minute oral presentation at the workshop. The accepted contributions will
  be combined into a single merged workshop paper which will be included and
  published to the proceedings of IEEE AVSS 2023.

  <strong>Sung Whan Yoon (UNIST):</strong> He is currently an assistant professor
  at Graduate School of AI &amp; Department of Electrical Engineering at Ulsan National
  Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST) since Mar. 2020. He received a Ph.D.
  degree from School of Electrical Engineering at Korea Advanced Institute of Science
  and Technology (KAIST), in Aug. 2017, under the supervision of Prof. Jaekyun Moon.
  Before joining UNIST, he was a postdoctoral researcher at KAIST from Sep. 2017
  to Mar. 2020. His research interests are in the area of artificial intelligence,
  distributed learning systems, and intelligence communications. When focusing on
  the machine learning field, he has been dedicated to meta-learning algorithms for
  few-shot image recognitions (the results were published in ICML 2019 &amp; NeurIPS
  Meta-Learning Workshop 2018). Also, he is interested in implementing algorithms
  for incremental/continual learning (the work was published in ICML 2020). In the
  further direction, he has suggested a domain generalization algorithm across diverse
  image domains (the related work was published in AAAI 2023). He is also interested
  in federated learning systems for training deep models in a decentralized/private
  way (a recent work that combines meta-learning and federated learning was presented
  at AAAI Privacy-Preserving AI Workshop 2023).
